Hello! 

This is my final project idea. 
Since I want to be a dentist, I thought hey, let's do one about carries and dental health. 

I want to highlight questions like "Does income per household have an effect on %carries?" 
or "How much sugar intake is the threshold for a cavity? What DNA sequences are linked to 
increased carries?" and questions of that caliber. 

The data sets that I would use for these would be public data from NHANES, which is only 
one source of data, but they have a large range of data dimensions, such as RIDAGEYR which 
would mean age in years. (Age is a big variable in cavity vulnerability!) 
The main data sets that I want to explore are 
Cavities
Age
Sugar intake 
SES*
Fluoride(proxy)
Genetic variants (GWAS catalog) 

*socioeconomic status

For creating data graphs and plots, I'm hoping to make clear linear line graphs with the
associated dimensions in order to find clear results for my hypothesis.
